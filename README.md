# Web-Design-Challenge

In this project I created a visualization dashboard website plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so user can easily visually compare them.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  
The website have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.

Finally, the website was deployed to GitHub pages.
